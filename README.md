# About PIQUE-LITE

Before talking about PIQUE-LITE, we need to give a short introduction about PIQUE。

PIQUE: a Platform for Investigative software Quality Understanding and Evaluation. PIQUE is a collection of library functions and runner entry points designed to support experimental software quality analysis from a language-agnostic prespective. To remain language-agnostic, this project provides the abstractions, interfaces, and algorithms nesscessary for quality assessment, but leaves but leaves the task of defining language-specific static analysis operations to dependent language-specific projects that will use MSUSEL-PIQUE as a dependency. 

Pique-Lite is an application used to visualize PIQUE results in tree structures. PIQUE-LITE is a react application that lets users upload PIQUE results, and display the result as a hierarchy tree structure. PIQUE-LITE also allows users to upload many PIQUE result files at once. These results data will be automatically integrated into different data visualization graphs on its Dashboard.

# Setup

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
